\section{Project Overview}
We aim to design a mobile banking application with a strong emphasis on extreme usability specifically for elderly and novice users in Ethiopia. Rather than redesigning an existing application, our approach is to create an entirely new interface from the ground up, informed by the unique challenges these user groups faceâ€”such as limited digital literacy, reduced cognitive or visual capacity, and unfamiliarity with mobile financial services. The project acknowledges that the resulting design may not be immediately adoptable on a wide scale due to infrastructural, cultural, branding and even security reasons. However, the primary objective is to derive meaningful insights into inclusive design practices and to propose a solution that maximizes accessibility, clarity, and confidence for underrepresented users. This project intends to contribute to the growing discourse on digital inclusion in financial technology. Ultimately, we hope that our findings and prototypes can inspire more thoughtful, user-friendly designs in real-world banking applications that better serve elderly and first-time users, particularly in low-resource settings like Ethiopia.
